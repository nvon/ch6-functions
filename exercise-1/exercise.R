## Exercise 1: writing and executing functions

## Write a function `AddThree` that adds 3 to an input value
AddThree <- function(value) {
  return(value +3)
}


## Create a variable `ten` by passing 7 to your `AddThree` function
ten <- AddThree(7)

## Write a function `FeetToMeters` that converts from feet to meters
FeetToMeters <- function(Feet)
  feet <- 
  meters

## Note: if you come with metric background, you may want to do the following three questions
## in the opposite way: create function 'metersToFeet' and compute you height in feet below


## Create a variable `height.in.feet` that is your height in feet


## Create a variable `height.in.meters` by passing `height.in.feet` to your `FeetToMeters` function
